Hello, this is my account and I love someone that is half Real Life and half Fantasy

I am a computer science student who loves to adore things from backend to trees (especially AVL Tree and Red Black Tree)

This is where I collect all of my public stuff (personal project) and my private stuff (assignments).
Have a free time to look around :)


Owh, free wallpaper for you
